      <div id="main-info">

          <p>
            Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
            businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal),
            SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a
            multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company,
            Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that
            would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space
            Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity
            in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking
            on an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's
            administration.
          </p>
          <p>
            In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the
            wealthiest man in the world.
          </p>
          <h4>Early Life</h4>
          <p>
            Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a
            child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his
            parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.
          </p>
          <p>
            At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk
            developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to
            program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he
            created called Blastar.
          </p>
          <p>
            In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was
            bullied until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned
            how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.
          </p>
          <h4>Eduction</h4>
          <p>
            At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s
            University and avoid mandatory service in the South African
            military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part
            because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship
            via that path.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the
            University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate
            degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in
            physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California
            to pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed
            perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford
            after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first
            company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in
            2002.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Companies</h4>
        <div>
          <div class="company-info"><i>iZip2Corporation</i></div>
          <p>
            Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his
            brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing
            content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the
            Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation
            bought Zip2 for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock
            options.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="company-info"><i>PayPal</i></div>
          <p>
            In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2
            to found X.com, an online financial services/payments company. An
            X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation of PayPal
            as it is known today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was
            acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk
            owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="company-info"><i>SpaceX</i></div>
          <p>
            Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies
            Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building
            spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
            established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle
            cargo transport for the International Space Station—with plans for
            astronaut transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own
            space shuttle missions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company
            launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule.
            The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1,000
            pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the
            first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the
            International Space Station. Of the launch, Musk was quoted as
            saying, "I feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super
            Bowl."
          </p>
          <p>
            In December 2013, a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to
            geosynchronous transfer orbit, a distance at which the satellite
            would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth's rotation.
            In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the
            Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe
            the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids and
            communications systems on Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 2017, SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of
            a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts, a development that
            opened the door for more affordable space travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            A setback came in November 2017, when an explosion occurred during a
            test of the company's new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported
            that no one was hurt, and that the issue would not hamper its
            planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with
            the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket.
            Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was
            designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve
            as a vessel for deep space missions. For the test launch, the Falcon
            Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster,
            equipped with cameras to "provide some epic views" for the vehicle's
            planned orbit around the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late March 2018, SpaceX received permission from the U.S.
            government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the
            purpose of providing Internet service. The satellite network, named
            Starlink, would ideally make broadband service more accessible in
            rural areas, while also boosting competition in heavily populated
            markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019, and
            followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While
            this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the
            appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the
            potential of thousands more to come, worried astronomers who felt
            that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of
            studying distant objects in space.

          <div class="company-info"><i>Tesla Motors</i></div>
          <p>
            Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a
            company formed in 2003 that is dedicated to producing affordable,
            mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar
            roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design
            of the company's products
          </p>
          <p>
            Five years after its formation, in March 2008, Tesla unveiled the
            Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in
            3.7 seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges
            of its lithium ion battery.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic
            partnership with Toyota, Tesla Motors launched its initial public
            offering in June 2010, raising $226 million.
          </p>
          <p>
            In August 2008, Tesla announced plans for its Model S, the company's
            first electric sedan that was reportedly meant to take on the BMW 5
            series. In 2012, the Model S finally entered production at a
            starting price of $58,570. Capable of covering 265 miles between
            charges, it was honored as the 2013 Car of the Year by Motor Trend
            magazine
          </p>
          <p>
            In April 2017, Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to
            become the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious
            boon to Tesla, which was looking to ramp up production and release
            its Model 3 sedan later that year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In September 2019, using what Musk described as a "Plaid
            powertrain," a Model S set a speed record for four-door sedan at
            Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey County, California.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Model 3 was officially launched in early 2019 following
            extensive production delays. The car was initially priced at
            $35,000, a much more accessible price point than the $69,500 and up
            for its Model S and X electric sedans.
          </p>
          <p>
            After initially aiming to produce 5,000 new Model 3 cars per week by
            December 2017, Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018, and then to
            June with the start of the new year. The announced delay didn't
            surprise industry experts, who were well aware of the company's
            production problems, though some questioned how long investors would
            remain patient with the process. It also didn't prevent Musk from
            garnering a radical new compensation package as CEO, in which he
            would be paid after reaching milestones of growing valuation based
            on $50 billion increments.
          </p>
          <p>
            By April 2018, with Tesla expected to fall short of first-quarter
            production forecasts, news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the
            head of engineering to personally oversee efforts in that division.
            In a Twitter exchange with a reporter, Musk said it was important to
            "divide and conquer" to meet production goals and was "back to
            sleeping at factory."
          </p>
          <p>
            After signaling that the company would reorganize its management
            structure, Musk in June announced that Tesla was laying off 9
            percent of its workforce, though its production department would
            remain intact. In an email to employees, Musk explained his decision
            to eliminate some "duplication of roles" to cut costs, admitting it
            was time to take serious steps toward turning a profit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restructuring appeared to pay dividends, as it was announced
            that Tesla had met its goal of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars per week
            by the end of June 2018, while churning out another 2,000 Model S
            sedans and Model X SUVs. "We did it!" Musk wrote in a celebratory
            email to the company. "What an incredible job by an amazing team."
